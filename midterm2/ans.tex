	  \item [(b)] \text{}\\ 
      The (a) figure show that the value of y will be changed in large range(from positive infinity to negative infinity) between x-value -1 to -5. Therefore, we cannot calculate accurate answer for this formular and we cannot get a numeracal answer.
      
      \item [(c)] \text{}\\

    \item [2.]
    \begin{enumerate*}
      \item [(a)]
      $\because$ p is prime, and p is coprime between all integers from 1 to p except number 1 \\
      $\therefore \ phi(p)\ is\ p-1$ 
      
      \item [(b)]
      Obervation: \\
      $\phi(11) \times \phi(13) = \phi(11 \times 13)$ \\
      In my opinion, all distinct prime numbers p and q can be done by this observation because p and q are different numbers and they are coprime.
      
      \item [(c)]
        \ 
        \begin{enumerate*}
          \item [(i)]
          Suppose we have distinct prime number p and q.
          
          \item [(ii)]
          $\because$ p is prime number, and q is also prime number \\
          $\therefore\ \phi(p) = p-1,\ \phi(q) = q-1,\ \phi(p)\phi(q)=(p-1)(q-1)$
