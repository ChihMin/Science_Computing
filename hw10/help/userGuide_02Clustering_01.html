%% Hierarchical Clustering
% Hierarchical clustering tries to combine or divide a dataset into clusters iteratively, such that a tree-like hierarchical structure is created, primarily for data visualization. To constructed such a hierarchical tree structure, we can adopt two approaches: 
%
% * Agglomerative hierarchical clustering: We can start from the tree leaves (or data instances) and combine two nearest clusters into one at each iteration. 
% * Partitional clustering: We can start from the root of the tree (which contains all data instances) and select a cluster to split at each iteration. 
%
% We shall focus on the agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering
% in this toolbox.
%% A basic example
% The following example demonstrates the dendrogram after agglomerative hierarchical clustering. 
data=rand(2, 50);			% 50 data instances of dim 2
distMat=distPairwise(data);		% Distance matrix of 50 by 50
hcOutput=hierClustering(distMat);
hierClusteringPlot(hcOutput);		% Plot the dendrogram
%% Use of different cluster distances
% We apply different cluster distance functions to obtain the corresponding tree structures, as follows: 
data=rand(2, 50);			% 50 data instances of dim 2
distMat=distPairwise(data);		% Distance matrix of 50 by 50
method='single';
hcOutput=hierClustering(distMat, method);
subplot(1,2,1); hierClusteringPlot(hcOutput); title(['method=', method]);
method='complete';
hcOutput=hierClustering(distMat, method);
subplot(1,2,2); hierClusteringPlot(hcOutput); title(['method=', method]);
%%
% From the resultant tree structures, we can observe the following trends:
%
% * Single linkage tends to make the tree slide to one side, with bigger clusters stay big and smaller clusters stay small.
% * Complete linkage tend to generate balanced trees, with all clusters growing big simultaneously.
%% Visualization of the clustering process
% If you want to see the animation of the clustering process, try the next example: 
clf
DS=dcData(6);
data=DS.input;
distMat=distPairwise(data);
hcOutput=hierClustering(distMat, 'single');
hierClusteringAnim(data, distMat, hcOutput);
%%
% MATLAB will display the animation as the clustering goes.
% It can be proved that the resultant connections via single linkage over a 2D dataset is actually the minimum spanning tree of the dataset.
%
% Of course, if we switch to the cluster distance of complete linkage, the
% plot will be quite different:
clf
DS=dcData(6);
data=DS.input;
distMat=distPairwise(data);
hcOutput=hierClustering(distMat, 'complete');
hierClusteringAnim(data, distMat, hcOutput);
