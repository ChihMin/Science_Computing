Once the toolbox is expanded into a folder, enter that folder and run "mltSetup" to setup the toolbox.

Run "mltDoc" to bring up a list of functions. Run "mltDoc dtw" to show the documentation of "dtw" command, etc.

To get started, run "doc" and click "Machine Learning Toolbox/Getting Started"
